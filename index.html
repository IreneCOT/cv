        <p><em>Software Manual Tester graduate at <strong><a href="https://wantsome.ro/">Wantsome</a></strong> </em></p>
        <p>Although over the last few years I invested much of myself in entrepreneurship, a while back I made the decision to reset my professional priorities. The idea of working in a more dynamic environment started to make more sense to me and as
          I entered the software development industry I started to flirt with a few areas that seemed challenging for my level of experience: office management, human resources or different support roles.
          Being also exposed to the delivery side of things, I also made contact with the world of software testing and I think I found a new passion at that point.</p>
